### Description: 
**Create a new project using Vite and Vue 3 and define the necessary components to structure the layout as per the attached screenshot. Once the macro-block structure is ready, populate the menu items dynamically using the component's data. For today, we prioritize the structure: when everything is solid, we move on to Sass!**


### Bonus: 
**Create an additional component to manage the blue bar with the icons.**
